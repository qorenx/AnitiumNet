This project has been cancelled. It is currently working. There are minor errors.

1: There is a big bug in the comment system. Post/get position returns after sending/deleting.

2: The monitoring system is too old. The url method is not good. Use properly.

3: Converter.php is old system. Get doesn't do it. It pulls with the landing system.

4: API system crashes. GogoanimeAPI style.

5: No customization of adding anime. Cast, PV, Season etc.

6: Fansub system is the old method. It doesn't work very well. Error. Even default is not normal.

7: Community works well, but the future is not promising.

8: SQL is old school. Too slow. Even if it supports 10 thousand anime, a good server is needed.

9: I do not support CodeIgniter4 upgrade. I do not provide help support.

10: The schedule is not good.

Note: Not supported. Only questions and answers are given. Minor errors will be helped.

The original new project AnitiumQ is ongoing. It will be a sequel project and a stable version.
